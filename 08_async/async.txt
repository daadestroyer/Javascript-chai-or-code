>>> javascript is by default synchronous means, a single threaded application


synchronous/blocking code
-------------------------
synchronous means an application which has single thread and things are getting executed one by one. We can also say that it's a 
blocking code meaning if one code is getting executed then at that same time other code is not able to get execut

asynchronous/non-blocking code
------------------------------
asynchronous means an application which as multiple threads and multiple things are getting executed parallely. We can also say that
it's non-blocking code meaning if one code is getting executed at that same time other code can also be able to execute . that's
getting possible with the help of different threads
