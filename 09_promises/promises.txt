Promise
--------
>>> the promise object represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value, meaning 
    hamne kisi function se promise lekar rakkha hai ko wo function apna poora kam karke hame result lake dega, lekin wo function turant
    result lake nahi dega bas usne promise kia hua hai ki wo result lake dega after some time not immediatly 

>>> promise hamesha future me jake complete hota hai (may be in some seconds/minutes/hours)



>>> promise always take one function and that function takes two parameters which are resolve or reject. if promise if fulfull means
    promise if fulfull if not means promise is reject
